## Getting Started

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create an account">
        Create an account over at [console.contiguity.com](https://console.contiguity.com) â€“ this is our new dashboard!
    </Step>
    <Step title="Generate a new API token">
        Generate a new API token or use the default one in the [Console](https://console.contiguity.com/dashboard/tokens).
    </Step>
</Steps>


## Update your code

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="HTTP" icon="globe">
        Our v2 API is now on `api.contiguity.com`. Update your base URL to this, and use the your API token in the `Authorization` header.
        ```http
        https://api.contiguity.com
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="JavaScript" icon="js">
        Our v2 SDK is now `contiguity`, instead of `@contiguity/javascript`. Update your import to this. We've also switched around some methods.
        ```javascript
        import { Contiguity } from "contiguity";
        const contiguity = new Contiguity("contiguity_sk_...your_token...");
        ```

        Switched methods:
        ```javascript
        // v1
        const res = await contiguity.send.text({
            to: "+1234567890",
            message: "Hello from Contiguity!"
        });
        ```

        ```javascript
        // v2
        const res = await contiguity.text.send({
            to: "+1234567890",
            message: "Hello from Contiguity!"
            // no more beta_features, just pass from: {} & attachments[]
        });
        ```

        See our [JavaScript SDK documentation](/sdk/js/overview) for more details.
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Python" icon="python">
        We're working on our new Python SDK. For now, you can use our API with any HTTP client you like.
        ```python
        # ... coming soon ...
        ```

        See our [Python SDK documentation](/sdk/python) for more details.

## Update your webhooks

Our webhook format has changed. Update your webhook to use the new format defined in [our v2 webhook documentation](/api-reference/webhook/example-v2).

## All set!
We've worked to make this migration as smooth as possible. If you run into any issues, feel free to email our support at [help@contiguity.support](mailto:help@contiguity.support) or join our Discord server.

Our new platform is built to be more flexible and scalable, and already supports more than 5x more features than v1. We're excited to see what you build with it!
