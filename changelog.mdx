**Contiguity Voice** — Coming to more customers soon. Docs and edge-case fixes in progress.

**Reverse OTP** — New product. Free on all plans. Users message you to verify their phone; no number leasing. We use it in production for onboarding. [Reverse OTP](/api-reference/product/otp/reverse/initiate)

**Onboarding latency** — Initial load reduced by 6x.

**Incoming Emails** — Verify a domain, set a webhook URL, receive incoming emails. Free and unlimited during beta.

**Console** — High-volume senders: "recent messages" tables now support pagination. Uptime visibility in the sidebar so you can see if Contiguity is having issues.

**Message tracking (early beta)** — Updates at each hop, API to device.

**Python SDK v2** — Shipped. Docs coming soon.

**Coming** — Fetch webhook events via the API; API errors will link to relevant docs when available.

<Update label="November 1, 2025" tags={["Console", "SMS/MMS", "Voice", "API", "iMessage"]}>
**Console** — Feature development in progress. MMS out of beta.

**Contiguity Voice** — Preview next week.

**Incoming iMessage attachments** — On the way.

**Message path tracking** — Timeline of a message's path (e.g. given to API, sent to carrier, delivered).

**Uptime visibility** — See status directly in the Console.

**API errors** — Will return links to relevant docs when available.

**Risk calculation** — Revamped; accuracy improved ~30% using real-world Console data. More transparent (what contributed to your score, similar to Stripe's fraud risk visuals).
</Update>

<Update label="September 15, 2025" tags={["SMS/MMS"]}>
**MMS shipped early** — Public beta, no entitlements required. [MMS docs](/api-reference/product/text/mms)

Customers who lease numbers from Contiguity can now receive attachments. We receive them from the carrier and host them for you.

MMS supports longer messages — up to 1500 characters before splitting (no more 160-character chunks). Billing for MMS is still being finalized; currently priced as text.
