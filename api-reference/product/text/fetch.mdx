<Tip>
**Distinguish between incoming and outgoing messages by checking the ID**
- Incoming messages have an ID that starts with `evt_`
- Outgoing messages have an ID that starts with `text_`, `imessage_`, or `whatsapp_`
</Tip>

<Note>
Contiguity has no way to query messages from carriers. Contiguity can only return messages we have processed and stored.
