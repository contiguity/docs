<Frame caption={`Contiguity delivers reactions by sending a special message to the recipient’s device. On older devices that do not support reaction messages, the recipient will instead receive a regular text in the format: <br/> \`{Reaction} "{Message}"\` — for example, \`Loved "Hello, world!"\``}>

<Warning>
Reactions are billed as a single SMS on the Usage tier, included in the Unlimited plan, and deducted from your quota on the Free tier. <br/><br/> There are no additional charges. Both adding and removing reactions count toward your quota.
