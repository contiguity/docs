<Warning>
`from` behavior is highly dependent on your account's setup!
</Warning>

<Info>
The sender email configuration depends on your account setup:
- If you haven't verified a domain: You can only use Contiguity's email infrastructure. Simply provide your sender name (e.g. 'Contiguity').

- If you have verified a domain: You can either:
  - Use your verified domain (e.g. 'Contiguity \<custom@your-domain.com\>')
  - Or still use Contiguity's email address (e.g. 'Contiguity \<random-hash@contiguity.email\>')
