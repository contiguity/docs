## Getting Started
Use of Contiguity's services requires an account to be made with Contiguity. This, apart from needing a connection to the internet, is all you need to begin using Contiguity.

<Note>
    The API only accepts JSON. Ensure you set the `Content-Type` header to `application/json` to avoid errors.
</Note>

## Base URLs
When sending requests, the base URL for your requests will likely be:
```
https://api.contiguity.com/
```

However, for some data or requests, you may encounter base URLs such as:
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="orwell.contiguity.com">
    You'd make requests here if you're fetching data from our analytics platform, Orwell.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="api.identity.contiguity.com">
    You'd make requests here when using our identity service, Identity.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="api.base.contiguity.co">
    You'd make requests here when using our NoSQL database service, Base.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="api.compliance.contiguity.com">
    You'd make requests here when using our regulatory compliance service, Compliance.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

We'll let you know if you're sending a request to a base URL different from `api.contiguity.com`.

## Authentication
When using the API, attach an `Authorization` header that's equal to `Token YOUR_TOKEN_HERE` in each request.

<Note>
    Authentication is required for most endpoints Contiguity provides.
</Note>

## API Best Practices

### Avoid "spamming" the API
While Contiguity's API can scale and is meant to handle millions of requests, it still rate limits users beyond a certain amount of requests per second. Avoid, for example, polling `/otp/verify` with every digit your user types - instead wait for all 6 digits before requesting verification.

### Respect local laws
Contiguity was designed to not be required to follow certain 'regulations', i.e A2P 10DLC registration in the US. However, it is still up to you, the user, to follow all laws applicable to you (i.e, in the US, CAN-SPAM) - not Contiguity's.

## API Status
Contiguity strives for >99.99% uptime. In the event Contiguity begins to return any `5xx` error, check Contiguity's [status page](https://status.contiguity.com). If an incident hasn't been marked as `Investigating`, please notify Contiguity immediately via email (help@contiguity.support) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/pCuTaY84Vy)
