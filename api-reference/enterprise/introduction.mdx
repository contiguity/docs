## Enterprise Base URLs
When sending requests using Enterprise features, the base URL for your requests will likely be:
```
https://api.contiguity.com/
```

However, for some data or requests, you may encounter an Enterprise-specific base URL:

```
https://api.enterprise.contiguity.com/
```


We'll let you know if you're sending a request to a base URL different from `api.contiguity.com`.

## Authentication
When using the API, attach an `Authorization` header that's equal to `Token YOUR_TOKEN_HERE` in each request.

<Note>
    Authentication is required for most endpoints Contiguity provides.
</Note>

### Secure your tokens at all times
It is advisable to never use your account token in production. You can generate throwaway tokens in the [Console](https://console.contiguity.com/), that can easily be revoked in the end of misuse by an unauthorized third party.
