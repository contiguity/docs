    </ParamField>

    ### domains.register(params)

    <ParamField body="domain" type="string" required>
      The domain name to register (e.g., "example.com"). Must be a valid domain you own.

    ## Using Custom Domains
    Once your domain is verified, you can use it to send emails with your brand:

    ```typescript
    // Send email from your custom domain
    const res = await contiguity.email.send({
      to: "user@example.com",
      from: "Your App <hello@yourdomain.com>", // Use your verified domain
      subject: "Welcome to our platform!",
      html: "<h1>Welcome!</h1><p>Thanks for joining us.</p>",
      text: "Welcome! Thanks for joining us.",
      reply_to: "support@yourdomain.com"
    });
    ```

    ## Domain Verification
    After registering a domain, you'll need to:

    1. **Add DNS records** provided in the registration response to your domain's DNS settings
    2. **Verify ownership** by ensuring the DNS records are properly configured
    3. **Wait for verification** which typically takes a few minutes to complete

    The verification status can be checked using the `domains.get()` method.

    <Note>
      Make sure to add all required DNS records (DKIM, SPF, DMARC) to ensure optimal email deliverability and to prevent your emails from being marked as spam.
    </Note>

    <Warning>
      Deleting a domain will immediately stop all email sending from that domain. Make sure to update your email configurations before removing a domain.
