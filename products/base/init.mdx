## Context
Base was a response to Deta abruptly shutting down their Cloud product, which included an easy-to-use NoSQL database. 
We reverse-engineered their API and released Base as a drop-in replacement for thousands of stranded developers.

<Warning>
  Base is no longer accepting new users, but we will continue to support it for existing users.
</Warning>

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the SDK">
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="JavaScript">
        Use `npm` to install the Base SDK:
        ```bash
        npm install @contiguity/base
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Python">
        Use `pip` to install the Base SDK:
        ```bash
        pip install contiguity_base
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Initialize the Client">
    After installation, import Base into your project and initialize it with your API key and project ID.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="JavaScript">
        ```javascript
        // Using CommonJS
        const contiguity = require('@contiguity/base')
        const db = contiguity.db("your-api-key", "your-project-id")

        // Using ES Modules
        import contiguity from '@contiguity/base'
        const db = contiguity.db("your-api-key", "your-project-id")
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Python">
        ```python
        from contiguity_base import connect
        db = connect("your-api-key", "your-project-id")
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    <Note>
      You can get an API key from the [Console](https://console.contiguity.com/dashboard/base). You can get the project ID when you create a new project, or when you click on the project in the Console.
