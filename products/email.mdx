## Installing the SDK
<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the SDK">
    Contiguity is working on adding several SDKs over the coming months, including ones for Swift, Java, Dart, and more.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="JavaScript">
        Use `npm` to install `@contiguity/javascript`

        ```bash
        npm i @contiguity/javascript
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Python">
        Use `pip` to install `contiguity`
        ```bash
        pip install contiguity
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Initialize the Client">
    After installation, import Contiguity into your project and give it your token.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="JavaScript">
        ```javascript
        const contiguity = require('@contiguity/javascript')
        const client = contiguity.login("your token here")
        ```

        You can also initialize it with the optional 'debug' flag:

        ```javascript
        const client = contiguity.login("your token here", true)
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Python">
        ```python
        import contiguity
        client = contiguity.login("your_token_here")
        ```

        You can also initialize it with the optional 'debug' flag:

        ```python
        client = contiguity.login("your_token_here", True)
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Sending an email
As long as you provide Contiguity a valid token, and provide valid inputs, sending emails will be a breeze. Various email parameters can be configured in the [Dashboard](https://contiguity.co/dashboard/emails) such as tracking, custom domains, and more.

<Note>
    Contiguity supports, but not yet in the SDK, custom emails from your own domain. This is coming in December 2024.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="JavaScript">
    ```javascript
    // HTML email
    const object = {
        to: "example@example.com",
        from: "Contiguity", 
        subject: "My first email!",
        html: "<b>I sent an email using Contiguity</b>"
    }

    await client.send.email(object)
    ```

    Or, to send a plain text email:

    ```javascript
    // Plain text email
    const object = {
        to: "example@example.com",
        from: "Contiguity",
        subject: "My first email!",
        text: "I sent an email using Contiguity"
    }

    await client.send.email(object)
    ```

    Optionally, use `replyTo` and `cc`.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Python">
    ```python
    # HTML email
    email_object = {
        "to": "example@example.com",
        "from": "Contiguity",
        "subject": "My first email!",
        "html": "<b>I sent an email using Contiguity</b>"
    }

    client.send.email(email_object)
    ```

    Or, to send a plain text email:

    ```python
    # Plain text email
    email_object = {
        "to": "example@example.com",
        "from": "Contiguity",
        "subject": "My first email!",
        "text": "I sent an email using Contiguity"
    }

    client.send.email(email_object)
    ```

    Optionally, use `replyTo` and `cc`. At the moment, `cc` only allows one email address.
