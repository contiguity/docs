Verification Reports are generated upon completion of a Verification Session. Even if a Verification Session fails or requires input, a Verification Report will still be generated with a unique Verification Report ID.

## Data Privacy
Verification Reports contain sensitive information about the user. This includes images of their identity document, their selfie, and extracted data from the document. You should not store this information yourself, and should instead fetch it on a need-based basis from Contiguity.

## Fetching a Verification Report
You can fetch a Verification Report using the `client.identity.verificationReports.get` method.

    <Tab title="JavaScript">
        ```javascript
        const verificationReport = await client.identity.verificationReports.get("vr_id");
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Python">
        ```python
        verification_report = client.identity.verificationReports.get("vr_id")
        ```
    </Tab>

## Redacting a Verification Report
When you no longer need Identity Data from a Verification Report, or a user requests that you delete their data, you can redact the Verification Report. This will redact the data from the Verification Report, keeping only the Verification Report ID and metadata.

Redact a Verification Report using the `client.identity.verificationReports.redact` method.

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="JavaScript">
        ```javascript
        await client.identity.verificationReports.redact("vr_id");
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Python">
        ```python
        client.identity.verificationReports.redact("vr_id")
        ```
    </Tab>
