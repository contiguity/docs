Contiguity offers a free OTP API that simplifies phone number verification using OTPs via SMS, which eliminates the need to develop custom logic. Gone are the days of paying for this simple feature.

<Warning>
    Contiguity still bills you for the text messages on our Usage tier, includes them in Unlimited, and subtracts them from your quota if you're on the Free tier. 
    
    We don't charge extra for the OTP API.
</Warning>

## Sending and Verifying OTPs
<Steps>
<Step title="Send an OTP">
    To verify a user's phone number, you'll first need to send them an OTP.

    ```typescript
    const res = await contiguity.otp.new({ 
        to: "+1234567890", 
        language: "en", 
        name: "MyApp" 
    });
    ```

    <Note>
      The `name` parameter is optional, but recommended. It customizes the message to say "Your [name] code is...", e.g. "Your Twilio code is..."
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify the Code">
    When your user inputs the code, verify it using the OTP ID from the previous step.

    ```typescript
    const res = await contiguity.otp.verify({ 
        otp_id: "otp_123", 
        otp: "123456" 
    });
    ```

    <Note>
      The verification will return a boolean (true/false). OTPs expire 15 minutes after sending.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Resend if Needed">
    If needed, you can resend an OTP using the original OTP ID.

    ```typescript
    const res = await contiguity.otp.resend({ 
        otp_id: "otp_123" 
    });
    ```

    <Note>
      Resending an OTP does not renew its expiry time.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>
