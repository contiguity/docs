  domain: "example.com" 
});
```

### Parameters

<ParamField body="domain" type="string" required>
  The domain name to get details for (e.g., "example.com").
</ParamField>

## Using Custom Domains
Once your domain is verified, you can use it to send emails with your brand:

```typescript
// Send email from your custom domain
const res = await contiguity.email.send({
  to: "user@example.com",
  from: "Your App <hello@yourdomain.com>", // Use your verified domain
  subject: "Welcome to our platform!",
  body: { 
    html: "<h1>Welcome!</h1><p>Thanks for joining us.</p>",
    text: "Welcome! Thanks for joining us."
  },
  reply_to: "support@yourdomain.com"
});
```

## Domain Verification
After registering a domain, you'll need to:

1. **Add DNS records** provided in the registration response to your domain's DNS settings
2. **Verify ownership** by ensuring the DNS records are properly configured
3. **Wait for verification** which typically takes a few minutes to complete

The verification status can be checked using the `domains.get()` method.

<Note>
  Make sure to add all required DNS records (DKIM, SPF, DMARC) to ensure optimal email deliverability and to prevent your emails from being marked as spam.
</Note>

<Warning>
  Deleting a domain will immediately stop all email sending from that domain. Make sure to update your email configurations before removing a domain.
