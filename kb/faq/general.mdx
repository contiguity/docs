## Getting Started

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I get started with Contiguity?" icon="play">
    Getting started is super simple.

    1. **Create an account**

    Sign up using GitHub at [contiguity.com/onboarding](https://contiguity.com/onboarding). In most cases, we won't even require you to verify your identity.

    2. **Generate an API key**

    Create a revocable API key in the [Console](https://console.contiguity.com). Name it something memorable!

    3. **Install an SDK**

    Using npm for JavaScript (`@contiguity/javascript`) or pip for Python (`contiguity`). Or, use our [REST API](https://docs.contiguity.com/api-reference).

    4. **Start building!**

    You're ready to integrate Contiguity into your app.
