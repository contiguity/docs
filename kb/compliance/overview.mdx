### You're Free From Carrier Regulation Hell
Contiguity believes in empowering developers to communicate freely without jumping through dozens of hoops, such as A2P 10DLC registration -- a process that can take weeks to complete.

Contiguity's method of sending SMS, MMS, & RCS messages means you can begin sending messages within minutes of signing up, and carriers can't use their traditional enforcement methods against you.

With Contiguity, you don't have to:
- Register for A2P 10DLC
- Go through carrier vetting
- Identify yourself as a sender (e.g. "This is a message from Chase Bank")
- Include opt-out language
- Pay carrier surcharges on already-expensive messages

#### iMessage & WhatsApp
Generally, SMS rules do not apply to iMessage & WhatsApp. You're not required to register for A2P 10DLC / carrier vetting, no opt-out language is required, and no carrier fees apply.
