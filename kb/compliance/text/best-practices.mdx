Unfortunately, due to increasing numbers of spam each year, carriers have become more aggressive in blocking messages, which has made it more difficult for legitimate individuals and businesses to send messages.
To maximize the chances of your message delivering, we recommend the following some basic guidelines:

### Learn about prohibited content over SMS/MMS

### Links

  <Card title="Don't send shortened links" icon="link-simple-slash">
    Fraudsters use shortened links (bit.ly, tinyurl, etc.) to hide a link's true destination. Most carriers won't deliver messages that contain shortened links.

    If a provider classifies your domain as malicious or spammy, some carriers won't deliver messages that contain links to it.

Ideally, you should send links after a user has interacted with you (replied).
Messages that contain links are more likely to be flagged as spam, which can ruin your domain's reputation with carriers -- especially if the message is reported as spam, the user replies "STOP," or you don't get a reply at all.
