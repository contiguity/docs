Primarily in the United States, but also abroad, carriers filter SMS and MMS messages using a variety of methods, including:

- **Keyword filtering**: Carriers block messages that contain certain keywords.
- **Content filtering**: Carriers block messages that contain prohibited content using machine learning.
- **Number filtering**: Carriers block messages from blacklisted numbers (e.g., those consistently reported as spam).

<Warning>
Local carriers ultimately have the authority to determine what kind of traffic flows over their networks. This means that the carriers might impose restrictions on SMS / MMS that exceed the minimum requirements of the law.
</Warning>

## Prohibited Topics
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="High-risk financial services" icon="money-bill">
    - Payday loans
    - Short term high-interest loans 
    - Third-party auto loans
    - Third-party mortgage loans
    - Student loans
    - Cryptocurrency

    "Third-party" means originating from any party other than the one which will service the loan. SMS messages featuring financial investment advice or tips, as well as information on loans and refinancing options, are prohibited. Carriers also prohibit messages with links to donation sites.

    Legitimate financial institutions may use SMS in accordance with certain restrictions, and often leverage text alerts for suspicious card activity, appointment reminders, and other transactional messages.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Third-party lead generation services" icon="database">
    - Companies that buy, sell, or share consumer information

    Buying, selling, or sharing of consumer data is strictly prohibited. The business that obtained consent is the only business authorized to send SMS. "Cold" outreach is the solicitation of business from potential customers who have had no prior contact with the business and is strictly prohibited.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Debt collection or forgiveness" icon="hand-holding-dollar">
    - Third-party debt collection
    - Debt consolidation
    - Debt reduction
    - Credit repair programs

    Almost all debt consolidation and forgiveness efforts are prohibited for SMS and MMS. Regarding debt collection, the business owed the debt can send payment reminders to late payers, personalized messages with account details, and follow up on payment confirmations. However, a third party cannot attempt to collect the debt for you via SMS and MMS.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="'Get rich quick' schemes / MLM" icon="chart-line">
    - Work-from-home programs
    - Risk investment opportunities
    - "Get rich quick," "build your wealth," and "financial independence" offerings
    - Multi-level marketing, network marketing and pyramid schemes

    Multi-level marketing (MLM) products, services, or content commonly associated with unsolicited commercial messages (spam) are prohibited. This is different from outreach about employment as a result of compliant opt-in practices, messages from brokerages to their members, investment news alerts, or other investment-related messages.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Illegal substances" icon="cannabis">
    - Marijuana/Cannabis
    - CBD/THC
    - Prescription drugs
    - Vaping

    Cannabis is federally illegal in the United States. Cannabis businesses will not be permitted to use SMS/MMS messaging in the US, regardless of message content. CBD is federally legal, but is not legal in some US states, so US carriers do not permit messaging related to CBD. Offers for drugs that cannot be sold over-the-counter in the US/Canada are forbidden.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Gambling" icon="dice">
    - Casino apps
    - Gambling websites

    While gambling traffic is allowed, as long as proper age gating procedures are in place. However, message delivery may still suffer.
